Issues 22Feb16

1. After fixing up a couple of things (the double line, transparent borders) the Zip code is out of line. It remains so no matter what I do! 
2. Can the text change color when the user as selected the state? 
3. No idea how to go about styling the button and checkbox?! 


Any help much appreciated! Thank you!
