Online Registration Form


Issues 22Feb16

1. The double borders are not the same length, this gets worse as the screen gets bigger.. 
2. Need to add arrow to 'Choose State' box. I think this has to be done with :after and an image? 
2a. Can the text change color when the user as selected the state? 
3. No idea how to go about styling the button and checkbox?! 
4. The 'Sign Up' button won't centre.
5. The CSS Validator gives these errors, but without them I cannot style the dropdown button: 
    72		::-webkit-input-placeholder is an unknown vendor extended pseudo-element
    103		Property -webkit-appearance is an unknown vendor extension
    104		Property -moz-appearance is an unknown vendor extension

Any help much appreciated! Thank you!
